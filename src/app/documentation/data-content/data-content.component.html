        A stable set of (two or more) interacting macromolecules such as proteins which can be co-purified by an
        acceptable method and have been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Any interacting,
        integral non-protein molecules (e.g. small molecules, nucleic acids) may also be included.

          <b> Complex recommended name</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The most informative, well accepted name in the literature, that is intuitive to the user. Where possible,
          this will be the same as the equivalent component term in GO. The term should always end in the word 'complex'
          or homo'n'mer. The recommended name is kept consistent when a complex is conserved across a taxonomic range.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt><b>Complex systematic name</b></dt>
        <dd>Derived using the Reactome rules for naming complexes. In principle this is a string of gene names of the
          participants of the complex separated by a colon (e.g. "fiba:fibb:fibg"). The order is determined by the order
          of synthesis of the complex. Where several participants join at the same time, or the order is unknown,
          alphanumeric order is used. Recommended gene names for each model organism will be used; therefore the
          systematic name may not be consistent when a complex is conserved across a taxonomic range.

          Currently, an appropriate designation for the complex with species indicated using the UniProt five letter
          code e.g. fibrinogen_human, tfiid_mouse. When the same complex is conserved across a taxonomic range, the root
          name is maintained across all entries e.g. fibrinogen_human, fibrinogen_mouse, fibrinogen_bovin.
